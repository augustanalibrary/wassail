# WASSAIL

WASSAIL originally stood for "Web-Based Augustana Student Survey Assessment of Information Literacy." This acronym has lost some of its relevance, because WASSAIL's functionality and applications have expanded since it was created. However, WASSAIL still pays homage to the hot apple drink often enjoyed at Augustana in recognition of Augustana's Scandinavian heritage.

WASSAIL, from its origins in Old Norse, means "be in good health."
